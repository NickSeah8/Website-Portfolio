This is my personal resume portfolio website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Flask**. 
This website provides details on who I am, the work I have done, my certifications, and my contact information in an interactive, responsive and neon layout.
I have originally built this website with a Python Flask app structure and left the relevant files (and folder structure) for those who wish to use this website as a template skeleton for their own Flask website. However, I have also ensured it can be hosted on GitHub Pages by making a copy of the HTML file in the main folder.

## Features
- Neon-themed UI with hover effects and animations.
- Interactive mouse trail and smooth scroll effects.
- Contact section with buttons linking to:
  - Resume (downloadable PDF)
  - LinkedIn
  - GitHub
  - Tableau Public
  - NovyPro
- Work Experience section with embedded certification badges.
- Fully responsive design.
