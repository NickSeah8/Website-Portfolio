                        My name is Nicholas Seah. I'm 25 years old and located in Sydney, although I grew up in a city around 2 hours north called Newcastle.
                        After finishing high school, I attended the University of New South Wales where I studied a Bachelor of Arts and Business, with a major in Media and a minor in Global Development.
                        <br> I began working as an Operations Coordinator in the cinema advertising firm Val Morgan, but after discovering an interest in data analytics (and finding myself in Europe for a couple months after quitting the advertising industry), I went back to university to complete a Master of Commerce, with a major in Business Analytics.
                        <br> This led me to joining the Data School program with MIP Australia, where I began my career as a Data Analyst. While I was initially drawn to the industry by the wonders of data visualization and storytelling through charts and dashboards, it was here that I found my love for the backend side of data.
                        I particularly enjoy writing and utilizing Python to read and extract data, transform and manipulate it, and output it depending on the need and use case. <br> It's for this reason that I particularly enjoy the end-to-end process of data pipelines and the use of cloud systems in modern enterprises.
                        I am also proficient with the use of SQL to explore data and manage databases and data warehouses/lakes. 
                        While I am aware of the dangers of AI, I enjoy learning and utilizing its' capabilities and understanding how it works, especially when it comes to LLMS, NLPs, and it's use in machine learning and regression models.
                        <br> Outside of work, I follow and play a lot of different sports. Growing up I would try every sport there was available, but the main sport I focused on was Tennis. This lasted until I was about 14/15, which is when I pivoted and began to play Rugby Union. These days, I mainly play a lot of basketball, and I have played in a number of social leagues and regularly attend weekend pickup runs with some mates.
                        <br> While I follow a lot of competitions such as the NRL, NFL and the F1, I am particularly passionate about the NBA. Following the NBA is how my interest in data was first piqued - I would spend hours reading game boxscores and looking up advanced statistics.
                        The YouTube channel 'Thinking Basketball' was the final catalyst that led me to deciding data and sport were the intertwining points in my personal and professional life. The way he would break down the game using both analytics and knowledge of the sport got me very excited about the possibilities that lay ahead of me. 
                        <br> Outside of sport, I also enjoy playing music, camping in nature, and other activities such as Skiing/Snowboarding, Surfing, Freediving and playing video games.
                        <br> I'm always looking to further my abilities, which is why I created this website as a part of my resume. I hope you like it &#128512;

                    <p>
                        Music has been a passion of mine since I was young. I have numerous playlists of songs for all different types of moods, weather and times of the day. Spotify might be my most used app across my lifetime! 
                        <br> I really enjoy the art of playing and creating music. I initially started when I was young with the piano, before moving on to violin and playing in my school's symphony orchestra. After discovering a particular love for rock and pop punk music, I picked up the guitar and also learnt how to play the bass guitar and drums.
                        <br> However, I found my favourite instrument involved using my own vocals to sing my favourite songs. I've always held an appreciation for interesting lyrical content that provokes thoughtful meaning, promotes important and universal themes, and utilizes clever and interesting analogies. Basically, all the lessons I learnt in English class back in school inspired my desire for lyrics that go beyond what basic pop songs tend to be about.
                        <br> Some of my favourite bands include Fall Out Boy and Panic at the Disco - their long song titles and interesting lyrics captured my attention as a teenager. Other pop punk bands I enjoy include my two favourite bands All Time Low and 5 Seconds of Summer, as well as classics such as Green Day, Paramore, and Blink 182. Recently, I have been listening to alot of The Maine, The Band Camino and State Champs.
                        <br> I have always considered myself a fan of all different types of genres. Oldschool rap such as Eminem, Dr Dre and Snoop Dogg have always captured my attention, as well as newer rap styles that verge on emo, with artists such as Lil Tjay, Cordae, Lil Uzi Vert and the Kid Laroi being some of my favourites. Other hip hop artists I also really enjoy include Action Bronson, J Cole and Drake.
                        <br> I spent alot of my 2023 trip to Europe finding quaint jazz bars to enjoy a whiskey and some jazz music, particularly 1920s to 1940s jazz. Indie artists such as Matt Hansen and Noah Kahan have greatly inspirted my own music craft, and electro music such as The Chainsmokers, Purple Disco Machine, and Illenium have captured my attention since I began to discover the party lifestyle at 18. Most recently, I've been very into country music, and have been listening to artists such as Luke Combs, Bailey Zimmerman, and Morgan Wallen.
                        <br> Since I was 15, I have been writing my own music. Over the years, I've taken inspiration from all the different genres I listen to, and whatever my favourite songs are at that current stage. Having played in various different rock bands throughout high school, I have always gravitated to a high distortion, punk kind of style when playing live and when originally writing, but I have always tried to incorporate a different inspiration into each of the original songs I create.
                        <br> I have made a playlist with all the original songs I have made over the years and uploaded to Spotify across different artist profiles. I have also shared a playlist with all my current favourite songs - if you are interested, the link to my Spotify profile is below, where you can find all my other playlists I have created. I hope you enjoy it!
