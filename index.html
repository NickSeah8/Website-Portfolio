                        My name is Nicholas Seah. I'm 25 years old and located in Sydney, although I grew up in a city around 2 hours north called Newcastle.
                        After finishing high school, I attended the University of New South Wales where I studied a Bachelor of Arts and Business, with a major in Media and a minor in Global Development.
                        <br> I began working as an Operations Coordinator in the cinema advertising firm Val Morgan, but after discovering an interest in data analytics (and finding myself in Europe for a couple months after quitting the advertising industry), I went back to university to complete a Master of Commerce, with a major in Business Analytics.
                        <br> This led me to joining the Data School program with MIP Australia, where I began my career as a Data Analyst. While I was initially drawn to the industry by the wonders of data visualization and storytelling through charts and dashboards, it was here that I found my love for the backend side of data.
                        I particularly enjoy writing and utilizing Python to read and extract data, transform and manipulate it, and output it depending on the need and use case. <br> It's for this reason that I particularly enjoy the end-to-end process of data pipelines and the use of cloud systems in modern enterprises.
                        I am also proficient with the use of SQL to explore data and manage databases and data warehouses/lakes. 
                        While I am aware of the dangers of AI, I enjoy learning and utilizing its' capabilities and understanding how it works, especially when it comes to LLMS, NLPs, and it's use in machine learning and regression models.
                        <br> Outside of work, I follow and play a lot of different sports. Growing up I would try every sport there was available, but the main sport I focused on was Tennis. This lasted until I was about 14/15, which is when I pivoted and began to play Rugby Union. These days, I mainly play a lot of basketball, and I have played in a number of social leagues and regularly attend weekend pickup runs with some mates.
                        <br> While I follow a lot of competitions such as the NRL, NFL and the F1, I am particularly passionate about the NBA. Following the NBA is how my interest in data was first piqued - I would spend hours reading game boxscores and looking up advanced statistics.
                        The YouTube channel 'Thinking Basketball' was the final catalyst that led me to deciding data and sport were the intertwining points in my personal and professional life. The way he would break down the game using both analytics and knowledge of the sport got me very excited about the possibilities that lay ahead of me. 
                        <br> Outside of sport, I also enjoy playing music, camping in nature, and other activities such as Skiing/Snowboarding, Surfing, Freediving and playing video games.
                        <br> I'm always looking to further my abilities, which is why I created this website as a part of my resume. I hope you like it &#128512;
